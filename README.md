# Solution-of-Laplace-equation-probabilistic-approach
This small piece of code calculates the solution of two elliptic equations using Mote-Carlo simulation: we define a markov chain with respect to the strcuture of the equation, taking average of a great number of samplings of this chain gives a approximative solution of the equation. 
It is done as a course project of the course "Sthochastic phenomenons modeling".
